    <h2>The City Gandhinagar</h2>
    <p>Gandhinagar is the capital city of Gujarat established as a modernized twin city for Ahmedabad. It was visualised
        as a planned city along the lines of New Delhi (by Edwin Lutyens), Chandigarh (by Le Corbusier) and Bhubaneshwar
        (by Otto H. Koenigsberger) . Located on the banks of the River Sabarmati, the city is the administrative centre
        of Gandhinagar and the capital of Gujarat as well. It does not seem to be a prudent concerted effort of creating
        Gandhinagar a Knowledge Hub by establishing several educational institutions of national and international
        repute, but it happened in sinusiodal phase during last one century or less.</p>
</div>
<div class="container rounded" style="font-size: 20px;text-align: justify;background: lightblue;">

<div class="container rounded" style="font-size: 20px;text-align: justify;background: lightblue;">

    <p>Besides this uniqueness of being developed as a Knowledge Corridor, Gandhinagar (including Ahmedabad, which is
